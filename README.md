Hi!

My name is Anatoli Miske and I am right now learning the basics of Web Dev. To do so, I follow the lessons of "The Odin Project".

I am a Graphic Designer based in Hamburg, Germany and have been illustrating all my life. But now i feel the urge to expand my skillset. 
My goal is to build a meaningful portfolio, that showcases all my skills.

Feel free to contact me via my [Hompage](https://anatolimiske.de/ "Anatoli Miske Hompage") (not *yet* developed by me).
